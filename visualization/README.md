# 🎆 YouTube Graph Visualization (3D Prototype)

This folder contains the **interactive 3D prototype** of the YouTube suggestion path graph, powered by `3d-force-graph` and built from data exported by the C++ backend.

⚠️ **Current Status:** DFS Prototype with Extended Search Support  
🔍 **Supported Search:** DFS, Dijkstra, A*, and Random Walk (DFS fully visualized; others export-ready) 
🎯 **Purpose:** Visually demonstrate search path reconstruction and node relationships

## ⚡ Quick Start (Local Server Required)

You **must** run a local server to view this visualization — opening `index.html` directly will result in a blank screen due to browser security policies.

### Option 1: Python 3 (no install needed)

```bash
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then open:

> http://localhost:5500

### Option 2: VSCode + Live Server

1. Open this folder in VSCode  
2. Install the “Live Server” extension  
3. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**

## 📦 Data Requirements

This prototype loads from two JSON files:

| File | Generated By | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `graph.json` | `exportFullGraphToJSON()` in `graph.cpp` | The full graph (all nodes and edges) |
| `search.json` | `exportTraversalToJSON()` for DFS | The traversal path and visited nodes |

✅ These files are automatically copied by the backend upon running a search.
Make sure you're using the DFS search before launching this prototype.

## 🧠 What It Shows

- ✅ Node color based on severity group (Safe → Extreme)
- ✅ Node size scales by group
- ✅ Hover reveals video title
- ✅ Traversed path is highlighted with thicker lines and directional arrows
- ✅ Start node marked in blue
- ✅ Graph auto-refreshes with updated data (cache-busting added)
- ✅ Optimized performance for large datasets (cooldown and layout tuning)

⚠️ **Flag counts** are not currently visible, but group-based visual encoding is fully active.

---

## 🔮 Future Expansion

- Enable visualization for A*, Dijkstra, and Random Walk ✅ (export-ready)
- Add controls to isolate or compare specific traversals
- Display live stat counts on hover or via legend
- Add filtering by group, stat threshold, or timestamp

---

## 🔐 Port Safety

This project uses local-only web servers.

- Port `5500` is not exposed externally
- No network or firewall changes are required
- Data and visualizations remain on your machine
