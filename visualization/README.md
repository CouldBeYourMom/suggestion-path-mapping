# 🎆 YouTube Graph Visualization (3D)

This folder contains the **interactive 3D visualization** of the YouTube suggestion path graph, powered by `3d-force-graph` and built with data exported from the C++ backend.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (Local Server Required)

You **must** run a local server to view this visualization — opening `index.html` directly will result in a blank screen due to browser security policies.

### Option 1: Python 3 (no installation needed)
From the `visualization/` folder, run:

```bash
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then visit:

> http://localhost:5500

### Option 2: VSCode + Live Server
1. Open this folder in VSCode
2. Install the "Live Server" extension (by Ritwick Dey)
3. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**

## 📦 Data Input (Required!)

This app loads data from `graph.json` in the same folder. This file is generated by running:

```bash
./main.exe export
```

> See: `exportFullGraphFromDB()` in `graph.cpp`

Make sure you copy the correct `graph.json` into this folder before launching. The file should contain:

```json
{
  "nodes": [...],
  "links": [...]
}
```

## 🧭 Features

- Auto-resizes with the browser window 🪐
- Node size scales with flag count
- Node color reflects flag group (Safe → Extreme)
- Hover to reveal title and flag count

## 🔐 Port Safety Notes

- Port **5500** is local-only — nothing is exposed externally
- Browsing at `http://localhost:5500` is completely safe
- Live Server and Python's `http.server` serve files **only to your machine**

No need for port forwarding or firewall changes unless you explicitly intend to share the visualization externally.
